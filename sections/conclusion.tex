\section{Conclusion}

\name is designed to enable true digital sovereignty for the first time by giving users the privacy and speed they expect. \name team members have built on decades of innovation in cryptographic systems---much of it their own---to create a platform that uniquely ensures the integrity and privacy of digital assets and communications. With \name, no-one can read your messages or steal your money. Period.

The \name platform protects privacy through an anonymous mixnet protocol, and a blockchain that stores tokens, not transactions. Likewise, it achieves finality quickly by abandoning the use of traditional signature-based payment processing in favor of hash-based authentications. This is achieved through the platformâ€™s unique consensus mechanism, whereby a group of system nodes works as a team, with integrity guarantees provided via verifiable proofs. In \name, future improvements in computational power translate directly to block finality being realized more quickly, and the architecture enables linear scaling of block processing as the network grows.

\name design is unique in being able to, for the first time, scale to provide users globally with a high performing payment and messaging solution that affirms and preserves their right to digital sovereignty.
